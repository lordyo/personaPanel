# Entity Simulation Framework Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid diagrams that illustrate the architecture, data models, and workflows of the Entity Simulation Framework.

## Available Diagrams

1. **System Architecture** (`system_architecture.md`)
   - Shows the high-level components of the system
   - Illustrates the relationships between frontend, backend, and external services
   - Maps the data flow through the system components

2. **Data Models** (`data_models.md`)
   - Displays the core data models and their relationships
   - Shows the entity type and instance structures
   - Illustrates the simulation engine and its components

3. **User Workflow** (`user_workflow.md`)
   - Provides a sequence diagram of the typical user journey
   - Shows how data flows between components during entity creation, simulation, and result analysis
   - Illustrates the API communication between frontend and backend

## Viewing the Diagrams

These diagrams are written in Mermaid markdown syntax and can be viewed in:

1. GitHub - which natively renders Mermaid diagrams
2. VS Code - with the Mermaid Preview extension
3. Online Mermaid editors like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor)
4. Any markdown viewer that supports Mermaid syntax

## Updating the Diagrams

As the system evolves, these diagrams should be updated to reflect changes in:
- Architecture
- Data models
- Workflows
- Component relationships

To update a diagram, simply edit the corresponding markdown file.
