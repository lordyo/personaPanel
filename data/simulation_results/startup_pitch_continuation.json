I should share my thoughts on the tech side; maybe it will spark a good discussion.*  \n'I've been thinking about a platform that uses AI to personalize user experiences in real-time. It could really enhance engagement, especially in marketing campaigns. What do you think?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *Alex's idea sounds promising. Personalization is key in marketing, and AI could take it to the next level. I need to connect the dots for him.*  \n'That sounds incredible! If you can tailor content to individual preferences, it could revolutionize how brands interact with consumers. Have you thought about how you would market such a platform?'\n\nROUND 3  \nAlex Chen: *Morgan's response is encouraging. I need to consider the marketing aspect more seriously.*  \n'That's a good point. I suppose I would need to highlight the data-driven insights it provides to marketers. It\u2019s all about showing them the value of using AI in their strategies. Do you think that would resonate with them?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I can see Alex is starting to think like a marketer. I should help him refine his pitch.*  \n'Absolutely! Emphasizing the ROI and how it can streamline their efforts would definitely catch their attention. Maybe we could brainstorm some marketing strategies together?'",
