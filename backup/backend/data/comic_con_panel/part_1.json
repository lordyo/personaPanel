I remember when we first started using them in the early 2000s; it was all about creating unique textures.*  \n'When we think about the iconic sounds in films like \"The Dark Knight,\" it\u2019s fascinating how synthesizers helped shape the atmosphere.'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I completely agree, Alex. The marketing side of things has also evolved alongside this technology. Audiences are now more aware of sound design, and it plays a crucial role in how we promote these films.*  \n'For instance, the trailer for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" used its soundtrack to create a nostalgic yet fresh vibe, which was heavily influenced by the synthesizer sounds.'\n\nJordan Rivera: *It's interesting to see how synthesizers have become a staple in modern film scoring. They allow for a wide range of emotional expression, which is essential in superhero narratives.*  \n'As a composer, I find that blending traditional orchestral elements with synthesizers can create a powerful emotional impact, especially in climactic scenes.'\n\nROUND 2\nAlex Chen: *I think one of the most exciting aspects is the technological advancements in synthesizers. The new software and hardware are allowing sound designers to push boundaries like never before.*  \n'Imagine what we can create with the latest modular synths! The possibilities are endless, and I believe this will only enhance the storytelling in superhero films.'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *Absolutely! And from a marketing perspective, we can leverage these advancements to highlight the innovative sound design in our campaigns.*  \n'For example, showcasing behind-the-scenes footage of sound designers at work can really engage audiences and build anticipation for the film.'\n\nJordan Rivera: *That\u2019s a great point, Morgan. I think it\u2019s also important to consider how these sounds resonate with audiences on a deeper level.*  \n'The emotional connection that synthesizers can create is something that can be highlighted in both the film and its marketing. It\u2019s about creating a cohesive experience for the viewer.'\n\nROUND 3\nAlex Chen: *Looking ahead, I wonder how the integration of AI in sound design will impact our work with synthesizers.*  \n'Will we see AI-generated sounds becoming a norm in superhero films? It\u2019s a double-edged sword, but it could lead to some groundbreaking innovations.'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *That\u2019s a fascinating thought, Alex. If we can market AI-generated soundscapes effectively, it could open up a whole new realm of possibilities for audience engagement.*  \n'Imagine a campaign that allows fans to interact with the sound design process through AI tools! It could create a buzz around the film before it even hits theaters.'\n\nJordan Rivera: *While AI can enhance creativity, I believe the human touch in composition and sound design will always be irreplaceable.*  \n'It\u2019s the emotional nuance that we bring to our work that truly resonates with audiences. Balancing technology with artistry will be key as we move forward.'",
