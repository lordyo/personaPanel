We need to strike a balance between innovation and tradition, ensuring that the emotional core of the sound is not lost.*  \n'In our marketing, we can emphasize the importance of maintaining that emotional connection, even as we explore new technologies.'  \n\nJordan Rivera: *Exactly! It\u2019s about finding harmony between the old and the new. We can use technology to enhance our storytelling without overshadowing the human element.*  \n'By fostering discussions around these challenges, we can engage the audience in a meaningful way, inviting them to be part of the conversation about the future of sound design.'"
