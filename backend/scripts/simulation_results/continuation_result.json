I need to stay focused on the practical aspects.*  \n'Morgan, as we discuss the budget for this project, how do you think we can balance creativity with the constraints we have?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I appreciate Alex's focus on practicality, but I want to ensure we don't stifle our creative ideas.*  \n'That's a great question, Alex! I believe we can allocate a portion of the budget for experimental marketing strategies. If we can show the potential ROI, it might justify the expense. What do you think about setting a timeline that allows for some flexibility?'\n\nROUND 4  \nAlex Chen: *Morgan's approach is always so dynamic. I need to consider how to incorporate flexibility without losing structure.*  \n'I agree that flexibility is important, but we also need to ensure we meet our deadlines. Perhaps we could create a phased approach where we test our ideas in smaller segments before a full rollout?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I love that Alex is thinking strategically! It makes me feel like we're on the same page.*  \n'Exactly! A phased approach could help us gauge audience reactions and adjust our strategies accordingly. Plus, it would allow us to stay within budget while still being innovative. How do you feel about presenting this plan to the team?'",

Old Ones.*  \n'What do you think about the concept of Jenkins serving these entities? It seems like a heavy burden for him.'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *Alex is always so analytical. I love that about him, but sometimes I wish he would just embrace the creativity of it all.*  \n'I think it adds a layer of tension! Jenkins is caught in this ritual, and it raises questions about duty and fear. Plus, Miss Blackwood's calmness amidst the chaos is fascinating. It makes me think about how people react to fear differently.'\n\nROUND 2\nAlex Chen: *Morgan's perspective is refreshing. I hadn't considered the emotional dynamics at play.*  \n'You're right; the contrast between Jenkins' dread and Miss Blackwood's serenity could create a compelling narrative. It might also reflect on how we face our own fears in life, don\u2019t you think?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I love that Alex is connecting it to real life! It shows his depth.*  \n'Absolutely! And the idea of serving these Old Ones could symbolize how we sometimes feel trapped by our own obligations. I can already see the marketing angle\u2014this could resonate with a lot of readers who feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities!'"
