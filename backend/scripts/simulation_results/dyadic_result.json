  "content": "ROUND 1\nAlex Chen: *This novella idea is intriguing, but it feels quite dark. I wonder how Jacob envisions the characters interacting with these... Old Ones.*  \n'What do you think about the concept of Jenkins serving these entities? It seems like a heavy burden for him.'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *Alex is always so analytical. I love that about him, but sometimes I wish he would just embrace the creativity of it all.*  \n'I think it adds a layer of tension! Jenkins is caught in this ritual, and it raises questions about duty and fear. Plus, Miss Blackwood's calmness amidst the chaos is fascinating. It makes me think about how people react to fear differently.'\n\nROUND 2\nAlex Chen: *Morgan's perspective is refreshing. I hadn't considered the emotional dynamics at play.*  \n'You're right; the contrast between Jenkins' dread and Miss Blackwood's serenity could create a compelling narrative. It might also reflect on how we face our own fears in life, don\u2019t you think?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *I love that Alex is connecting it to real life! It shows his depth.*  \n'Absolutely! And the idea of serving these Old Ones could symbolize how we sometimes feel trapped by our own obligations. I can already see the marketing angle\u2014this could resonate with a lot of readers who feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities!'",
