I need to focus on the pitches, but I can't help but wonder how my tech ideas could fit into the marketing strategies being discussed.*  \n'Hey Morgan, have you seen any pitches that caught your eye yet?'\n\nMorgan Taylor: *Alex seems a bit reserved, but I appreciate his analytical approach. I should encourage him to share his thoughts more.*  \n'Not yet, but I'm really excited to see how these entrepreneurs present their ideas. I think a strong marketing angle can make or break a pitch. What about you? Any tech ideas you're particularly interested in?'",
